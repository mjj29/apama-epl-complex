# EPL complex numbers
Apama EPL Class for handling complex numbers from EPL

## Supported Apama version

This works with Apama 10.5 or later, and probably most of the earlier ones as well

## Using complex numbers from EPL

To use Complex numbers from EPL, add Complex.mon to your project, or ensure you inject it before your EPL code. Then import the event into your file with:

	using com.apamax.Complex;

## Running tests

To run the tests you will need to use an Apama command prompt to run the tests from within the tests directory:

    pysys run
